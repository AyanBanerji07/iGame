            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game
              developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. It was released on iOS and Android devices in
              June 2018 and on Windows in November 2018, featuring cross-platform play between these platforms. The game
              was also ported for the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and has planned releases for the Xbox One, Xbox
              Series X and Series S, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in 2021. The game was inspired by the party game
              Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing, and since the release of its first map, The Skeld,
              three other maps were added, those being MIRA HQ, Polus and The Airship. The Airship's design is based on
              Infiltrating the Airship, the fourth entry in the Henry Stickmin series, another video game made by
              Innersloth. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two
              roles,
              most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates are to
              identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to
              covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be
              Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency
              meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are ejected or
              all tasks are completed, whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or
              if a critical sabotage goes unresolved. While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream
              attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and
              YouTubers playing it. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been credited to the growth of the game. The game
              received positive reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay and setting, although it was
              criticized for its technical issues. In response to the game's popularity, Among Us 2 was announced in
              August 2020. However, the planned sequel was canceled a month later, and the team shifted its focus to
              improving the original game. Merchandise based on the game, such as toys, shirts, etc., were announced and
              released. Among Us has also inspired internet memes and achieved a very large following online.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and
              released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same
              general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid-tower
              defense-shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects
              with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in
              which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are
              given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released
              in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World
              and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an
              overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year,
              earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and $9 billion in revenue in its first two years.

              Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and
              Creative were released for all those platforms, and also for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android devices.
              The game is expected to also launch with the release of the next-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
              X/S consoles.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was
              created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private
              testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens
              Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is
              the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold and 126 million monthly active users
              as of 2020. In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with virtually
              infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures
              or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate
              with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which
              players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players
              have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.
              Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest
              video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual MineCon
              conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational
              environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have
              been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for
              US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode,
              Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.</p>

              street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and arms smuggler Trevor Philips—and their efforts to
              commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open world
              design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based
              on Los Angeles. The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world
              is navigated on foot and by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player
              and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and
              many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law
              enforcement response to players who commit crimes. Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer
              mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes. The
              game's development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV's release and was shared between many of
              Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects
              such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to
              innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open
              world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage
              for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who
              collaborated over several years. It was released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in
              November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and April 2015 for Microsoft Windows. PlayStation 5 and
              Xbox Series X/S versions are scheduled for release in November 2021. Extensively marketed and widely
              anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in
              history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. It received
              widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world,
              presentation and gameplay. However, it caused controversies related to its depiction of violence and
              women. Considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among
              the best video games ever made, it won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several
              gaming publications. It is the second best-selling video game of all time with over 145 million copies
              shipped, and as of April 2018 the most financially successful entertainment product of all time, with
              about $6 billion in worldwide revenue.</p>
