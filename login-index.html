                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
                    entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which
                    is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of
                    aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are
                    also considered to be work. Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for
                    achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by
                    professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained
                    by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own
                    audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a
                    game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. Key components of games are
                    goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Gamesgenerally involve mental or physical stimulation, and
                    often both. Many gameshelp develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or
                    otherwiseperform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.</p>
